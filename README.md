## Where are the tests?
======================================

The tests are contained within the jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file. The tests confirm that the RSS Feeder is running properly by checking each feed for a name and URL, confirming the list of readers is hidden by default (but toggles on display), and confirming that each feed has a different set of links.
